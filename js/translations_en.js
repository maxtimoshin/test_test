  <p>By accepting the SpinBet Partners Cooperation Terms, the Affiliate confirms that they are 18 years of age or older.</p><br>
  <p>The Program may, at its discretion, verify or otherwise validate the accuracy and truthfulness of any registration information provided by the Affiliate. If at any time the Program, at its sole discretion, determines that the Affiliate's registration information is misleading, inaccurate, or untrue, the Program may restrict, prohibit, or terminate the Affiliate's account, access, and use of the Program, and/or any benefits received from the Affiliate's participation in the Program. The Program may also withhold payment of any commissions and/or other funds that may be due or payable to the Affiliate.</p><br>
  <p>A login and password are created to access the SpinBet Partners affiliate program system. The Affiliate is solely responsible for protecting these credentials from third parties. SpinBet Partners is not responsible for the security of these confidential data. The Affiliate Program recommends using two-factor authentication to protect the account.</p><br>
  <p>SpinBet Partners reserves the right to terminate cooperation with any Affiliate without providing reasons.</p><br>
  <p>The sale or transfer of accounts to third parties without prior approval from the Affiliate Program is strictly prohibited.</p><br>
  <p>SpinBet Partners Affiliate Program reserves the right to review and modify the rules of the Affiliate Program without the consent of the Affiliate and without prior notice.</p><br>
  <p>The rules published on the Program's website are considered effective. There is no record kept of the chronology of changes to the Affiliate Program rules.</p><br>
  <p>It is expressly agreed that the parties intend to establish a relationship between the Program and the Affiliate under this Agreement, but neither party intends to create a joint venture or make the Affiliate an agent, employee, or partner of the Program in any sense. The parties expressly agree that they are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership as contemplated by the Partnership Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c.348, and the parties have not granted each other any rights or authority to assume or create any obligations or liabilities, explicit or implied, on behalf of each other or to bind the other party in any way.</p><br>
  <p>It is also agreed that the Affiliate is not authorized to create or assume any obligations on behalf of the Program or on its own behalf, explicit or implied, or to act or intend to act as its agent or representative for any purpose, and the Affiliate has no right to position itself as possessing such authority.</p><br>
  <p>The Affiliate bears sole responsibility for the development, functioning, and maintenance of the Affiliate's website, as well as for all materials that appear on the Affiliate's website. These responsibilities include, among others, the technical operation of the Affiliate's website and all related equipment; creating and placing reviews, descriptions, and links to products on the Affiliate's website and linking these descriptions to the Program's website; the accuracy and correctness of the materials posted on the Affiliate's website; and ensuring that the materials posted on the Affiliate's website do not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third party, nor are they defamatory or otherwise illegal. The Program disclaims any responsibility for such matters. Except as provided in this section, the Affiliate may not sublease, lease, sell, resell, outsource, or service any Offer, and any attempt to do so will be invalid.</p><br>
  <p>The Affiliate may be granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license for the duration of this Agreement to use the trade name of the Program, trademarks, service marks, logos, and any other designations solely with the written permission of the Program's representative, exclusively in connection with the placement of advertising materials on the Affiliate's website. This license may not be sublicensed, assigned, or otherwise transferred by the Affiliate. The Affiliate's right to use the Marks is limited to this license and arises solely from this license. The Affiliate shall not assert the invalidity, lack of enforceability, or challenge the ownership of the Marks in any actions or legal proceedings of any kind or nature, nor shall it take any actions that may impair the Program's rights to the Marks, create similar marks, otherwise weaken their validity, or harm their associated reputation.</p><br>
  <p>If the Affiliate is not active, does not log in to the personal account and does not respond to messages on the contacts specified in the registration form for more than 90 days, his account may be temporarily blocked. To recover a blocked account, the Affiliate must contact support via mail or other messenger for further instructions from our Affiliate Manager.</p><br />

  cond_text2: `<p>The affiliate program reserves the right to request information about the partner's traffic sources at any time.</p><br>
  <p>IF THE PARTNER REFUSES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SOURCES HE/SHE ADVERTS THE CASINO WITH, THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND PAYMENTS TO THE PARTNER AND/OR TO BLOCK THE PARTNER’S ACCOUNT UNTIL THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF CONFIRMATION OF TRAFFIC SOURCES.</p><br>
  <p>For websites, it is necessary to provide the URL (or an alternative path to the domain). For media/arbitrage traffic, an example advertisement and a screenshot of the advertising account should be provided. For email campaigns, the email address support@spinbet.partners should be added to the mailing list, and the texts and templates of the emails should be shown. For public posts on social media, streaming channels, or mobile applications, the use of correct links is required.</p><br>
  <p>If the advertising uses languages not supported by the affiliate program, the partner is obliged to translate it upon request. The affiliate program operates under the "Last cookie wins" rule, which means that the player will be attributed to the partner whose advertising led to the player's registration with SpinBet Partners most recently.</p><br>
  <p>SpinBet Partners allows partners to send emails to players using their own contact databases, but only if the source of this data is specified. The email content must be pre-approved by the affiliate program and sent by a third party.</p><br>
  <p>Acquiring players through spam mailings is prohibited. If such spam mailings are detected, the affiliate program may close the partner's personal account in the SpinBet Partners system without paying out any earned funds stored in the account.</p><br>
  <p>The use of Branded traffic by partners is limited by the affiliate program through standard commission programs.</p><br>
  <p>For the SpinBetter.com RevShare project, the commission for branded traffic is 20%.</p><br>
  <p>Branded traffic refers to traffic generated by queries containing the names of the affiliate program projects in various forms, including with errors or typos. This definition also includes websites with copied or similar designs to the original. It is strictly prohibited to use the names of the Affiliate Program projects or Partner Project names with numbers that may resemble a project mirror for branded traffic, such as Spinbetter1, SpinBetter2, Spinbetter123, etc.</p><br>
  <p>If partners wish to use branded traffic, they need to contact the Affiliate Program and agree on the terms under which the Affiliate Program can accept this traffic. In case of intentional use of standard commissions for branded traffic and concealing this information, the Affiliate Program reserves the right to suspend cooperation with the partner.</p><br>
  <p>The use of incentivized traffic is prohibited by the Affiliate Program. If such traffic is detected, the Affiliate Program reserves the right to close the partner's account without warning and without paying out any funds stored in the account.</p><br>`,
  cond_text3: `<p>The standard commission program is the dynamic RevShare ranging from 20% to 55%, calculated using the formula:</p><br>
  <p>[(Bets - Wins) - Payment System Commissions - Royalty of Game Providers] * % RevShare = NGR * % RevShare, where:</p><br>
  <p>Bets - Wins (GGR) is the gross gaming revenue, calculated as the sum of all bets minus the sum of all wins;</p><br>
  <p>Payment System Commissions are the commissions of payment systems;</p><br>
  <p>Royalty of Game Providers is the commission of game providers;</p><br>
  <p>NGR (Net Gaming Revenue) is the same as net gaming revenue;</p><br>
  <p>% RevShare is your commission percentage.</p><br>
  <p>In the SpinBet Partners affiliate program, partners can work with CPA and Hybrid (CPA + RevShare) programs. These programs are established on an individual basis by agreement between the Affiliate Program and the Partner and can be canceled at any time with a 24-hour written notice to the Partner.</p><br>
  <p>If a partner works under the fixed commission model of RevShare and fails to attract new players to the affiliate program projects for 1 month or more, their fixed commission of RevShare can be changed to the minimum RevShare commission program, which is 20%, or to one that corresponds to their dynamic grid.</p><br>
  <p>At the start of the partnership, affiliate program representatives may offer a RevShare deal of 50% for the initial period of 1-2 months. After the first month, the conditions can be reviewed based on the volume of traffic and adjusted accordingly within the dynamic grid.</p><br>
  <p>Unified dynamic RevShare grid for sports betting and casino:</p><br>
  <p>0-9 — 20%</p>
<br />
<p>10-24 — 25%</p>
<br />
<p>25-34 — 30%</p>
<br />
<p>35-44 — 35%</p>
<br />
<p>45-54 — 40%</p>
<br />
<p>55-99 — 45%</p>
<br />
<p>100+ — 50%</p>
<br />
  <p>If during the calculation period there were player wins exceeding their deposits, meaning if the players attracted by the Partner caused losses to the Casino, the Partner's revenue for that calculation period is zero.</p><br>
  <p>If the Partner has a negative balance in the current calculation period, it can be carried over to the next calculation period.</p><br>
  <p>In such cases, the next calculation period starts with a negative value. Negative balance carryover can be disabled if the following conditions are met within 1 month:</p><br>
  <p>Number of registrations - 1000+</p><br>
  <p>Number of First-Time Depositors (FTD) - 100+</p><br>
  <p>Total deposit amount - $20,000</p><br>
  <p>Number of depositing players - 200</p><br>
  <p>If any of the metrics fall below these criteria, the negative balance carryover will be restored to the Partner.</p><br>
  <p>If a Partner refers to someone who wants to become a new Partner (sub-affiliate) and collaborate with the SpinBet Partners affiliate program, the referring Partner will receive referral bonuses.</p><br>
  <p>The size of the referral bonuses is 2-5% of the NGR earnings of all previously referred sub-affiliates for the calculation period.</p><br>
  <p>Any violation of the Sub-affiliate Terms by the Sub-affiliate will be considered a violation of this Agreement by the Affiliate.</p><br>`,
  cond_text4: `<p>The use of promotional materials (graphics, videos, logos, layout elements, text) from our SpinBetter project for the purpose of promoting the Partner's own projects is prohibited.</p><br>
  <p>In case of violation of this rule, the Partner's account may be blocked without any prior notification.</p><br>
  <p>It is prohibited to modify the logos of the Partner Program Projects in any way, including changing fonts, colors, or any other alterations that contradict the Brand Book. The Partner may request the Brand Book from their personal Manager if necessary.</p><br>
  <p>SpinBet Partners affiliate program provides its Partners with various textual and graphical materials (by prior agreement). Partners are allowed to use any information from the casino website and personal casino account, but only in their own words. If the text is copied from the casino website "as is," the Affiliate Program may terminate the partnership with the Partner or consider their traffic as branded.</p><br>
  <p>Affiliates of SpinBet Partners are prohibited from promoting SpinBetter through spam email campaigns, context advertising mentioning the SpinBetter or SpinBet Partners brand, and ClickUnder/PopUnder type of advertising. In case such actions are detected, the Affiliate's personal account will be closed, any accumulated funds will be voided, and commissions will be withheld. It is also prohibited to use false information about the casino and bonuses.</p><br>
  <p>The affiliate program may request the replacement of outdated links, screenshots, logos, and other advertising materials. If the Partner refuses to replace them, the affiliate program may postpone the payout indefinitely until the replacement is made.</p><br>
  <p>Information about SpinBetter.com and any other projects of the Affiliate Program in the Partner's reviews must be accurate. In case of providing false information that differs from the information on the project's websites, the affiliate program may suspend the partnership with the Partner.</p>`,
  cond_text5: `<p>Partners are prohibited from owning and using their personal accounts in any casinos that belong to the SpinBet Partners Affiliate Program through their own referral link. In case of violation of this rule, both partner accounts will be blocked, and funds from both accounts will be deducted. Such decisions are not subject to discussion. This rule also applies to the Partner's family members and close associates.</p><br>
  <p>The affiliate program reserves the right to adjust the Partner's balance by the amount lost by the casino due to fraudulent actions of players referred by the Partner. The Partner's balance may be adjusted for this reason for an unlimited period of time after the discovery of fraud.</p><br>
  <p>The affiliate program has the right not to pay the Partner the profit earned under the CPA model in cases where the Partner attracts non-genuine customers (players with multiple accounts, incentivized or fraudulent traffic, etc.). If the Affiliate Program administration notices any atypical player behavior (e.g., an unusually high percentage of players who do not return to the project after CPA qualification), the partner's income will be recalculated according to the standard RevShare commission.</p><br>
  <p>Deliberately providing false information about traffic sources to the Affiliate Program may result in termination of cooperation.</p><br>
  <p>The affiliate program has the right to terminate the Agreement and immediately block the Partner's account by sending a written notice of termination to the Partner in case of: insults towards the support and administration of the Affiliate Program and/or projects; misleading and/or false public statements about the Affiliate Program and/or projects. Misleading and/or false public statements may include text, actions, or any manipulation of information by the Partner without any supporting evidence (screenshots, links, etc.). Texts, images, or data in any other digital form containing offensive expressions or any other direct/indirect insults may be considered as insults towards the support and administration of the Affiliate Program and/or projects.</p><br>
  <p>If the Casino administration or the Affiliate Program administration has grounds to suspect a Partner of violating the Affiliate Program rules during the collaboration, their account may be blocked, and payouts may be frozen indefinitely until the circumstances are clarified. If the investigation concludes that a violation has occurred, the SpinBet Partners Affiliate Program has the right not to make any payouts to the Partner.</p><br>
  <p>In case of disagreements, the Partner should provide arguments in favor of their point of view and their proposed resolution of the existing situation to the Affiliate Program. The SpinBet Partners Affiliate Program is willing to consider all arguments presented by the Partner and find a solution that is fair from both perspectives. The decision of the Affiliate Program cannot be contested.</p>`,
  cond_text6: `<p>The program will pay the Affiliate a commission calculated according to the payment terms specified in each Offer posted by the Program on the Program's website. The Program applies payment plans of NET 60, NET 30, NET 15, or NET 7 at its sole discretion, depending on the volume and quality of traffic sent by the Partner unless otherwise agreed by both parties.</p><br>
  <p>Regardless of the chosen payment method (e.g., Neteller, Skrill, etc.), the Affiliate must provide their actual banking details to the Program.</p><br>
  <p>The Affiliate Program only makes payments to the details specified in the Partner's personal account. Changing the payment details can be done in the Partner's personal account independently. The Affiliate Program is not responsible if the payment was made to details from the Affiliate's personal account, but they turned out to be invalid or incorrect. The Affiliate bears full and sole responsibility for the accuracy of the data they provide. If the Affiliate wants to change the payment details, they must notify it by email to support@spinbet.partners using the email registered on the Affiliate Program's website. If such a notification is not sent or the message is received from an email that does not belong to the registered account, the request will not be considered and will be canceled.</p><br>
  <p>The program may, at its own discretion and from time to time, decide to transfer part or all of the Commissions to the Affiliate before receiving payment from the Client, but in no case is the Program obligated to do so.</p><br>
  <p>Commissions will be paid to the Affiliate only after the Program has received payment from the Client for such Offer, as published in the Program's online reporting system.</p><br>
  <p>The Partner receives a commission in the Affiliate Program, which is calculated as a percentage of the net revenue generated by the casino from players referred by the Partner. The Partner can choose the most advantageous commission model for them.</p><br>
  <p>Earnings for the previous settlement period are credited within five business days.</p><br>
  <p>The minimum withdrawal amount from the Partner's account is 50 EUR for payment systems and 500 EUR for bank transfers.</p><br>
  <p>Payment details can be changed no later than 5 business days before the end of the settlement period and before the payment period ends. The administration may withhold payments to partners whose players show suspicious activity or to new partners for a period of time deemed suitable for verification by the Affiliate Program.</p><br>
  <p>If the Partner attracts fewer than 5 players before the first withdrawal, additional verification of those players may be conducted.</p><br>
  <p>The Affiliate Program pays lifetime commissions for all commissions as long as the Partner fulfills all their obligations and does not cause any reputational or financial damage to the Affiliate Program or its projects.</p><br>
  <p>The Affiliate Program may withhold payments for CPA or Hybrid models for 7-21 days.</p>`,
  cond_text7: `<p>During the term of this Agreement and for a period of six (6) months thereafter, the Affiliate shall not attempt in any way to undermine the reputation of the Program, and in particular, the Affiliate shall not directly or indirectly: (1) solicit or entice, or attempt to solicit or entice, employment other than with the Program; (2) induce or entice, or attempt to induce or entice, any of the Program's employees to become employed by the Affiliate or a competitor of the Program; or (3) directly or indirectly enter into any agreement or contract, written or otherwise, with any Client or provide services to any third party for the ultimate benefit of a Client who, in the opinion of the Program, may compete with any services provided by the Program to that Client.</p>`,
  cond_text8: `<p>The Program's inability to strictly enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of the Program's right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No changes by employees or affiliates, as well as additions, deletions, or insertions to this Agreement, shall be recognized by the Program until published on the website. None of our employees or agents are authorized to make or agree to any changes or modifications to this Agreement or its terms.</p>`,
  cond_text9: `<p>The Program disclaims all warranties, conditions, representations, indemnities, and guarantees with respect to any matter, whether express or implied (including, without limitation, any warranties of profitability, satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, ownership rights, and non-infringement of rights).</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Program further disclaims all obligations and liability on the part of the Program and those for whom it is legally responsible for any damages, including, without limitation, indirect, special, and consequential damages, attorney's fees and expert fees, and court costs (even if the Program has been advised of the possibility of such damages, fees, or costs), arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. Under no circumstances shall the Program be liable to the Affiliate for any indirect, consequential, special, punitive, or incidental damages or lost profits of the Partner or its successors (including, without limitation, claims regarding loss of reputation, use, or reliance on services provided under this Agreement).</p>
  <p>Without limiting the foregoing, the Program shall not be liable for any failure or delay resulting from any actions of the government, fire, flood, riot, earthquake, power outage, civil unrest, explosion, embargo, strikes, legal or illegal, shortage of labor or materials, transportation interruption of any kind, slowdown, acts or omissions of the Affiliate or third parties, equipment or software of the Affiliate and/or any third-party equipment, or any other conditions affecting production or delivery in any manner beyond the control of the Program.</p>`,
  cond_text10: `<p>The Program may assign this Agreement without the prior consent of the Affiliate. The Affiliate may not assign this Agreement without the explicit written consent of the Program.</p><br />

No provisions or conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed waived, and no breach shall be justified unless such waiver or consent justifying the breach is in writing and signed by both parties.</p><br />
  <p>In the event that any provision or obligation of this Agreement is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be indefinite, invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then this Agreement with respect to the remaining terms, agreements, or conditions shall remain in full force and effect.</p><br />
  <p>This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of both the Program and the Affiliate and shall be binding on them. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter of this agreement, superseding any prior or contemporaneous statements, negotiations, agreements, and understandings, whether oral or written.</p><br />
